# Deep Learning 1 : CNN, CAM

* Implementing the forward and backward passes as well as the neural network training procedure
* Implementing the widely-used optimizers and training tricks including dropout
* Using TensorFlow to train and design a network
* Fine-tune trained networks
* Visualize the learned weights and activation maps of a ConvNet
* Use Grad-CAM to visualize and reason why ConvNet makes certain predictions
